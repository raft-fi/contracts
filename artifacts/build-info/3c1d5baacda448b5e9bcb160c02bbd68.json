over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow checks. Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\":\"SafeMath\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":100},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcc78a17dd88fa5a2edc60c8489e2f405c0913b377216a5b26b35656b2d0dab52\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://526dc85e1f9b9b45830e202568d267d93dde7a4fcccf4ad7798dadcd92304d3c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmaoXMB972J3cSDLtBq3xBo4jLwqD2uzXTwujtSPqkYVhR\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol":{"ERC20":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"name_","type":"string"},{"internalType":"string","name":"symbol_","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"value","type":"uint256"}],"name":"Approval","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"from","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"to","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"value","type":"uint256"}],"name":"Transfer","type":"event"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"}],"name":"allowance","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"approve","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"balanceOf","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"decimals","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"","type":"uint8"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"subtractedValue","type":"uint256"}],"name":"decreaseAllowance","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"spender","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"addedValue","type":"uint256"}],"name":"increaseAllowance","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"name","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"symbol","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"totalSupply","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"recipient","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"transfer","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"sender","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"recipient","type":"address"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"transferFrom","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"linkReferences":{},"object":"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

of the {IERC20} interface.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless {_setupDecimals} is called.
